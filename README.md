# How to use basic React js integration in Python using Flask Framework.

When working with Python and React, you typically use Python for the backend (server-side) and React for the frontend (client-side). 
Below is a simple example using a Python web framework, Flask, for the backend, and React for the frontend.

# Create a Flask App (backend):
Install Flask using pip if you haven't already:

pip install flask

Create a file named app.py 

# Create a React App (frontend):

Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed. Create a new React app:

npx create-react-app react-app
cd react-app
